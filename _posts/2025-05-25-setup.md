# What is the Maix Dock M1W?
![Maix Dock M1W]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Maix-dock.jpg "test"){: style="width:60%;" }

The Maix Dock M1W is a small RISC-V based Micro-controller, with the main point of interest being the integrated NPU called KPU. 
The board is based around the Kendryte K210 chip, which comes with 2 64bit RICS-V cores clocked at 400MHz and a dedicated NPU. 
The NPU is marketed with the ability to perform 1TOPS at INT8 precision.  
This makes the M1W an interresting product for low-power object detection.  

The specifictions for the M1W is as follows:  
*With ESP32-WROOM for comparision*
